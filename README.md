**Purpose**:
The purpose of this MVP tool is to allow medical residents to algorithimically and fairly schedule on-call shifts. 

A future release of this tool is intended to be a web based application whereby a user (a medical resident or chief medical resident) can input schedule/vacation preferences, indicate the completion of certain training/certifications, as well as request schedule changes.
